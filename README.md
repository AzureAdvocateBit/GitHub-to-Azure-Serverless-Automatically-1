## Session Abstract

Azure Function and Azure Logic Apps are part of the Serverless offer from Microsoft cloud Azure. But why should you care about serverless? What's an Azure Function or Azure Logic Apps? And can you create a continuous integration and continuous deployment solution for it? This session will answer all those questions and with demos helps you to be ready to deploy your first serverless solution to Azure.

## Deployment / Preparation

Deploying the demo environment on Azure - including the prerequisites.

[Instructions and prerequisites are outlined here](deployment/README.md). 


## Demos

> What's Here? Pre-delivery preparation, stage ready videos, required files (such as JSON templates), and walk-through videos

Detailed explanations of each demonstration associated with this presentation can be found in this section. There are 4 "live from stage" technical demonstrations that utilize a number of tools both in and out of Azure. [You can get a high level overview of the tools and how we will be using them here](demos/readme.md).
